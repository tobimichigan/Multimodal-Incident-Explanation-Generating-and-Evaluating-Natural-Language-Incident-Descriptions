Multimodal Incident Explanation: Generating and Evaluating Natural-Language Incident Descriptions with METEOR, CiDER-D and SPICE for Dashcam Data

</h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This paper introduces a multimodal framework that couples incident detection with natural-language incident explanation for dashcam footage. The system leverages compact, handcrafted video descriptors to trigger textual caption generation using a rule- and-template-based ImprovedTextGenerator, and evaluates textual fidelity with METEOR, SPICE and a novel CiDER-D metric. We describe dataset curation, model architectures, evaluation protocol and present extensive ablations and qualitative examples. Results show that motion- and edge-informed incident selection improves caption quality, and that CiDER-D better correlates with human judgments for short, structured incident descriptions. We provide reproducible implementation notes and discuss deployment considerations for traffic-safety applications.
